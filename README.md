# Centric Cucumber framework for web automation

This framework is intended to starting point for new Cucumber projects. The architecture, conventions and guidelines are a distillation of the experience of multiple Centric consultants across a wide variety of web automation projects over the years.

A flakey test suite can cripple a project.  If you can't trust your automation you can't move as quickly as you'd like.  Your test suite should tell you a story, if that story can't be believed then your suite is providing no value.

Our framework attempts to provide solutions to common problems, improve test reliability and reduce repetition.  Likewise we provide guidance on best practices and ways to avoid quality problems with your suite.  Wherever possible this guidance is ingrained so that it's difficult to do the "wrong thing".

**Warning:** The framework is intended to be used with Ruby version 2.4.2 or higher. While it's entirely possible older versions will work, no effort has been made to test this.
